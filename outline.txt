2. Algorithm (8 min)
2.1. Simplified assumptions 
2.2. Formulation of LP
2.2.2. Linear cost
	Linear cost function can be solved in Polynomial time using LP Solver.
2.2.3. Quadratic cost
	quadratic cost function is hard for LP solver.
	convex optimization can solve quad cost func in polynomial time. 
2.2.1. Constant cost
	constant cost function is hard.
	relaxation can be done.
2.2.4. Integer LP
	Integer LP is NP hard for LP solver.
	When cost function is convex, we can apply "multi edges" method and use LP Solver to solve in Polynomial time.
	When cost function is non-convex?
2.3. Validity of the results

TODO:
1. what input datasets we want to try?
ideas: how is the time cost scaled with the size of input?
